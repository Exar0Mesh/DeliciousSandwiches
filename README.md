This projects contains a Deli shop coded in the Java format. With it, you are able to order as many sandwiches, drinks, and chips and display them in a receipt. Not only that, but the total price is also displayed in the receipt. The ordered items are stored in an array so that you can order multiple sandwiches while still adding to the total. My interesting piece of code is that the Sandwiches and OtherProducts class's both direct their information through the scanner in the Screen class. This way they can be called, transfer information, and not have to require a separate scanner to be made for each.
